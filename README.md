# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_System_Final_Model

**Breast cancer** is one of the most common cancers among women in the world, accounting for the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today's society. It is a different kind of disease, in which the cells of the breast become uncontrolled and they expand in an uncontrolled manner. Breast Cancer is the frequently recognized cancer growth among ladies and a significant explanation behind the expanded death rate among ladies. 

It takes more time to diagnose manually and very few automated prediction systems were present, leads to building up a new prediction framework that identifies the tumors in early-stage with more prediction accuracy. 

Machine Learning algorithms using numerous **classification algorithms** were applied to classify whether the tumors are either benign or malignant in nature. Classification algorithms are well trained from the previous data and these can predict the new pattern from the current data received. Existing automated Breast Cancer prediction system gave lesser prediction accuracy from the Breast Cancer data set and the dataset is only about the image attributes which is not much convenient for the users. To enhance the accuracy of various prediction models, a novel **Majority-Voting Based Hybrid Classifier** (MBHC) is proposed to overcome the problems of predicting Breast Cancer,
